# Idmar Ramos Junior personal webisite

Hi, my name is Idmar (But you can call me just _Id_). I'm a brazilian UX Designer at [Booking.com](http://booking.com).
This is the code from my personal website [id.etc.br](http://id.etc.br). Feel free to fork and use this code in your projects.

## What you need:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org);
- [Bower](http://bower.io);
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

## Setup the project:
1. Open your command line tool and navigate to project folder;
2. Run `bower install` to install frontend dependencies;
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies;
4. Run `gulp` to start Gulp tasks;
5. Have fun developing;

Styles are in **sass/** folder and they will be compiled via `gulp` to a **css/** folder.

## Important
In case of you use this code as base to some project, PLEASE, **remove my Google Analytics code** from it!
