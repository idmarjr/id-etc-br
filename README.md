# Idmar Ramos Junior personal website

Hi, my name is Idmar (But you can call me just **Id**). I'm a Brazilian UX Designer at [Booking.com](https://booking.com).
This is the code from my personal website [https://id.etc.br](https://id.etc.br). Feel free to fork and use this code.

## What you need
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org);
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)

## Setup
1. Using your command line tool, navigate to project folder;
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies;
1. Run `gulp watch` to start Gulp tasks;

Styles are in `sass/` folder and they will be compiled via `gulp` to a **css/** folder.
